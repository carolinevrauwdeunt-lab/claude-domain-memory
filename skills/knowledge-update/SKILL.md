# Knowledge Update

Extract what was learned in this session and persist it to the project's domain memory files.

## When to Use

Run at the end of a session with `/knowledge-update` when:
- You just completed a non-trivial task
- You encountered a surprising bug, API quirk, or pattern
- Something worked differently than expected
- A previous hypothesis was confirmed or contradicted

## How It Works

### Step 1 — Identify the domain
Look at what was worked on. Map it to an existing domain file or decide if a new one is needed.

Existing domain files live in the project memory folder:
`~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/memory/domain_*.md`

Only create a new domain file if the work clearly belongs to a different domain than existing ones.

### Step 2 — Extract insights from the session

Review the conversation and identify:

**Facts** (certain, repeatable, no ambiguity):
- API behaviors, schema details, confirmed constraints
- "Property names are case-sensitive" — not "I think they might be"

**Hypotheses** (pattern seen, not confirmed enough):
- Things that worked once or twice but need more evidence
- Add to the hypotheses table with confirmation count 1

**Confirmations** (a hypothesis proved true again):
- Find the matching row in the hypotheses table
- Increment the confirmation count

**Contradictions** (a rule proved wrong):
- Move it back to Hypotheses with a note

### Step 3 — Apply promotion logic

- Hypothesis with **5+ confirmations** → move to Rules section
- Rule **contradicted by new data** → move back to Hypotheses with a note explaining what contradicted it

### Step 4 — Update the file(s)

Edit the relevant `domain_*.md` file(s). If creating a new domain file, also add it to `MEMORY.md`.

New domain file template:
```markdown
---
name: <Domain> domain knowledge
description: Facts, hypotheses, and confirmed rules about <domain> in <project>
type: domain
domain: <domain_name>
---

## Facts

## Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Confirmations | Last seen |
|---|---|---|

## Rules
_(none yet)_
```

## What NOT to store

- Information already in code comments or build instructions
- Things easily found by reading the current files
- Step-by-step how-to guides (those belong in instruction docs, not domain memory)
- Ephemeral task details from this session only

## Example output

After a session fixing a Notion API pagination bug:

> **Domain:** notion_api  
> **New fact:** `has_more` can be true even when `next_cursor` is null if the last page is exactly 100 items — always check both  
> **Hypothesis confirmed (2→3):** Filtering by `last_edited_time` is more reliable than filtering by a Done date field  
> **No promotions** — no hypothesis reached 5 confirmations

Then edit `domain_notion_api.md` accordingly.
